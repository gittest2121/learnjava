# Programming Paradigms
* A programming paradigm is a way of thinking about and structuring a program's functionality.
* Programming paradigms differ from one another, for example in how the program's execution and control are defined and what components the programs consist of.
* Most programming languages currently in use support multiple programming paradigms.
* The most common programming paradigms today are:<br>
  [-] Object-Oriented Programming<br>
  [-] Procedural Programming<br>
  [-] Functional Programming

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* In OOP, information is represented as classes that describe the concepts of the problem domain and the logic of the application.
* Classes define the methods that determine how information is handled.
* During program execution, objects are instantiated from classes that contain runtime information and that also have an effect on program execution:
  [-] Program Execution typically procceds through a series of method calls related to the objects.
  [-] "The program is built from small, clear, and cooperative entities."

## Procedural Programming
* In procedural programming, the structure of the program is formed by functionality desired for the program.
* Whereas in OOP, the structure of a program is formed by the data it processes.


```
The focus of Procedural Programming is to break down a programming task into a collection of variables, data structures, and subroutines, whereas in OOP, it is to break down a programming task into objects that expose behavior (methods) and data (members or attributes) using interfaces.

The most important distinction is that while procedural programming uses procedures to operate on data structures, OOP bundles the two together, so an "object", which is an instance of a class, operates on its own data structure.

Similar semantics with different nomenclature:

|==========================================|
|    Procedural    |    Object-Oriented    |
|==================|=======================|
|     Procedure    |        Method         |
|------------------|-----------------------|
|      Record      |        Object         |
|------------------|-----------------------|
|      Module      |        Class          |
|------------------|-----------------------|
|  Procedure Call  |       Message         |
|==========================================|
```
