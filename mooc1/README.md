# Variables
## Primitive Variables
Stores values<br>
(Variable's information is stored as a value of the variable)

## Reference Variables
Stores reference to the value<br>
(Holds a reference to the information related to that variable)<br>
Practically always Objects (in Java)<br>
<br>
Usually, when a constructor of a class is called, a reference to an object is returned and stored as the value of the variables<br>
