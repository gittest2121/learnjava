# Intermediate Operations
* Intermediate stream operations are methods that return a stream.
* Since the value returned is a stream, we can call intermediate operations sequentially. Typically intermediate operations include *converting a value from one form to another using ***map*** and its more specific form ***mapToInt*** used for converting a stream to an integer stream.*
* Other ones include
*filtering values with ***filter***,
indentifying unique values with ***distinct***,
and arranging values with ***sorted*** (if possible).*
