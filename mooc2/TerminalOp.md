# Terminal Operators
* The *count* method for *counting the number of values on a list.*
* The *forEach* method for *going through list values.*
* The *collect* method for *gathering the list values into a data structure.*
* The *reduce* method for *combining the list items.*

```
reduce(*initialState*, (*previous*, *object*) -> *actions on the object*)

The reduce method is useful when you want to combine stream elements to some other form.
