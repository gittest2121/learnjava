# Control flow Statements
While Java control flow constructs are identical to those in C and C++,
with a few exceptions.
There is no goto (by the way, it is a bad practice), but there is a labeled
version of "break" that you can use to break out of a nested loop.

Finally, there is a variant of the "for" loop that is similar to
range-based "for" loop in C++ and the "forreach" loop in C#
