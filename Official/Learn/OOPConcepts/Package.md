# Package
A package is a namespace that organizes a set of related classes and interfaces<br>
Similar to folders on your computer<br>
Because software written in the Java Programming language can be composed of hundreds or thousands of induvidual classes, it makes sense to keep things organized by placing related classes and interfaces into packages.

The Java platform provides an enormous class library (a set of packages) suitable for use in your own application, known as the _Application Programming Interface (API)_. Its packages represent the tasks most commonly associated with general-purpose programming.<br>
For example,<br>
a _String_ object contains state and behavior for character strings;<br>
a _File_ object allows a programmer to easily create, delete, inspect, compare, or modify a file on the filesystem;<br>
a _Socket_ object allows for creation and use of network sockets; various GUI objects control buttons and check boxes and anything else related to GUI. This allows you, the programmer, to focus on the design of the application, rather than the infastructure required to make it work

The _JAVA Platform API Specification (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/index.html)_ contains the complete listing for all packages, interfaces, classes, fields, and methods supplied by the Java SE platform
