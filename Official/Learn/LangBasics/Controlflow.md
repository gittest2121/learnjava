# Control Flow Statements
*Control flow statements* break up the flow of execution by employing
```
Decision making -- [ if-then, if-then-else, switch ]
Looping 	-- [for, while, do-while ]
Branching	-- [ break, continue, return ]
```
```
// Decision making
if-then 	-- Tells program to execute the section of code *only* if a particular test evaluates to true
if-then-else 	-- Secondary path of execution when an "if" clause evaluates to false
switch		-- Number of possible execution paths (Works with byte, short, char, int primitive data types and even works with enumerated types)

// Looping
for		-- Repeatedly loops until a particular condition is satisfied (Compact way to iterate over range of values)
while		-- Continually execute a block of statements while a particular condition is true
do-while	-- do-while evaluates its expression after being executed at least once, if its true; then loop

// Branching
break		-- labeled & unlabeled
