# Naming
## Note:
If we are talking about "fields" (in general, it is excluding local variables and parameters); we may simply say _"fields"_<br>
else if discussion applies to "all"; we may simply say _"variables"_<br>
***A type's fields, methods, and nested types are collectively called its members***

## Naming
1. Variable names are case-sensitive.<br>
*A variable's name can be any legal identifier -- an unlimited-length sequence of Unicode letters and digits, beginning with a letter, the dollar sign "$" or the underscore character "_"*

2. **Tips:**
* Avoid using variable names with dollar sign "$"
* Always start your variable names with a *letter, not "$" or "_"*
* White space is not permitted
* Use full words instead of cryptic abbreviations -- will make code easier to read and understand -- may also make code self-documenting
* Variable names should *not be a keyword or reserved word*
* If name is a *single word*, spell that word in *all lowercase characters*
* If your stores a constant value (Class variables with final keyword), such as, *static final int NUM_GEARS = 6* -- Captalize every letter and seperate subsequent words with the underscore character

# ALL VARIABLES MUST FIRST BE DECLARED BEFORE THEY CAN BE USED
