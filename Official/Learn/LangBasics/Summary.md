# Summary
* Instance variables (not-static fields) are unique to each (object) instance of a class.
* Class variables (static fields) are fields declared with the *static* modifier; there is exactly one copy of a class variable, no matter how many times class is instantiated.
* Local variables store temporary state inside a method.
* Parameters are variables that provide extra information to a method.
* Local variables and parameters are always classified as "*variables*" (not fields).
* For local variables, compiler never assigns a default value.
* A literal is a source code representation of a fixed value.
* An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type.
* The length of an array is established when the array is created. After creation, its length is fixed.
