# Learning the Java Language
## Object Oriented Programming Concepts
Teaches you the core concepts behind OOP objects, messages, classes, and inheritance

## Language Basics
Describes tradiitional features of the language, including variables, arrays, data-types, operators, and control flow

## Classes and Objects
Describes how to write the classes from which objects are created, and how to create and use the objects

## Annotations
Form of metadata and provide information for the compiler

## Interfaces and Inheritance
describes interfaces - what they are, why you would want to write one and how to write one<br>
Also describes the way in which you can derive one class from another.<br>
Essentially, how a _subclass_ can inherit fields and methods from a _superclass_<br>
You will learn that all classes are derived from the _Object_ class, and how to modify the methods that a subclass inherits from superclasses

## Generics
Powerful feature of the Java Programming Language<br>
Improve the type safety of your code, making more of your bugs detectable at compile time

## Packages
Feature of the Java Programming language that help you to organize and structure your classes and their relationship to one another.
